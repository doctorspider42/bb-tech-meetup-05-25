  content: `Hello Team,

I'm interested in your SUPER2000 software product and have a few questions before making a purchase decision:

1. Does it support integration with third-party APIs?
2. What's the pricing structure for a team of 10 users?
3. Is there a trial version available?

Thank you for your assistance.

Regards,
John Doe`,
