Hey,

This is ridiculous! I can't get into the database AGAIN and I have a super important meeting at 2pm today!!! Been trying since this morning and nothing works. Getting some stupid "Connection timeout" message and some code DB-504 whatever that means.

I'm so fed up with these systems always failing when I need them most! Already wasted half my morning trying to fix this myself - restarted my computer twice, my internet is working fine for everything else so that's not the problem. Even cleared all my browser stuff like you guys always tell us to do.

Need this fixed ASAP!!! How am I supposed to prepare for my meeting without access to my customer data?? My manager is going to kill me if I'm not prepared.

PS: This is the third time this month something isn't working right. When are we going to get reliable systems??`,
